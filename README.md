# Credibee

CrediBee addresses financial informality by establishing comprehensive financial records and building user creditworthiness and reputation. This application is carefully designed to enable easy record-keeping, thorough tracking of earnings and expenses, and simplified client feedback collection. By gathering and carefully checking income from various digital wallets through secure payment gateways, the system creates an up-to-date financial summary. From this reliable information, it evaluates a "CrediScore" which serves as a trustworthy measure of financial reliability.
